lofar-tools
===========

This repository is to allow me to keep the scripts I use for LOFAR
analysis synchronized between the various places I work.

It's possible some of these tools may be useful to other people.
No guarantees, no support.

Directories:

-- utils: general utilities to deal with CASA-format MSs and images and with
   FITS images from the command line. Used by other scripts. Most likely
   to be useful to others.

-- surveys: scripts used for the blank-field surveys.

-- blazar-pipeline: the pipeline I am developing with Sara Turriziani for
   processing blazar monitoring observations.

-- Martin
